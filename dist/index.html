    <div>
      I would like to be a scientist when I'm older. If you want to be one too, here are a few
      tips!
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li>Always have a journal to record everything and anything</li>
      <li>Don't be afraid to ask questions</li>
      <li>Don't get upset if it isn't right (all scientist make mistakes)</li>
    </ol>
